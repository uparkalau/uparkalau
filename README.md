Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here's a little bit about me:

👀 I’m interested in full stack development, with a focus on backend technologies such as PHP, MySQL, and Node.js. On the frontend side, I enjoy working with JavaScript and React to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my skillset and exploring the world of Python. I believe in continuously learning and improving my knowledge to stay up to date with the latest industry trends and technologies.

💞️ I’m always open to collaborate on projects that align with my skillset. If you have an exciting opportunity or a project that could benefit from my expertise, feel free to reach out!

📫 You can contact me via email at uladzimir.parkalau@gmail.com. I'm always happy to connect with fellow developers, discuss new ideas, or answer any questions you may have.
